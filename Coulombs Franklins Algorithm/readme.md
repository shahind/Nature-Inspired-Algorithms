Coulombs Franklins Algorithm


Coulomb's and Franklin's laws Algorithm (CFA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm which is inspired from Franklin's and Coulomb's laws theory. It is based on the impact of electrically charged particles on each other due to electrical attraction and repulsion forces.

Based on the paper:
