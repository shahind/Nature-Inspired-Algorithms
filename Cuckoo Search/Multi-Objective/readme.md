The multiobjective cuckoo search (MOCS) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm. This demo solves the bi-objective ZDT3 functions with D=30 (dimensions), and the obtained Pareto Front is displayed. It is relatively straightforward to extend this code to solve other multi-objective functions and optimization problems. You can change the objective functions, dimensionality, various parameters, and simple lower and upper bounds (Lb, Ub).
