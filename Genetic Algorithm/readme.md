test: test usage of Genetic Algorithm
uses file SphereNew
uses file GeneticAlgorithm (and all its other required files)

Other four commonly used test problems (Rastrigin, Schaffer, Griewank, Rosenbrock) are also available in the folder

Statistical analysis and other plots can be implemented as discussed in https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74091-teaching-learning-based-optimization

Also refer https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65767-single-objective-genetic-algorithm for an alternate implementation.
