The standard flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is inspired by the pollination characteristics of flowering plants. This demo solves the Ackley function of D=10 dimensions. It is straightforward to extend it to solve other functions and optimization problems. The details can be found in the book: Xin-She Yang, Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms, Elsevier Insights, (2014).
