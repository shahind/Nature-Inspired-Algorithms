MOFPA--Multi-objective flower pollination algorithm. This demo solves a bi-objective ZDT function of D=30 (dimensions), which can be extended to solve other multi-objective optimization problems. It is relatively straightforward to extend this code to solve other multi-objective functions and optimization problems. You can change the objective functions, dimensionality, various parameters, and simple lower and upper bounds (Lb, Ub).
