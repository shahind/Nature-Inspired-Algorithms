Bird Swarm Algorithm

This is a demo for the nature-inspired algorithm, Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA). Different from the most metaheuristic algorithms, the different individuals in BSA may have different search strategies. In this sense, BSA is an innate multi-swarm algorithm, and may show its superiority over some other metaheuristic algorithms.
