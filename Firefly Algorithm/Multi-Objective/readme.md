The multiobjective firefly algorithm (MOFA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm. This demo solves the bi-objective ZDT3 functions with D=30 (dimensions), and the obtained Pareto Front is displayed. It is relatively straightforward to extend this code to solve other multi-objective functions and optimization problems. You can change the objective functions, the dimensionality, and simple lower and upper bounds (Lb, Ub). Some parameter tuning to vary parameters slightly (such as theta, gamma, and number of iterations) may help improve the quality of the solutions.
