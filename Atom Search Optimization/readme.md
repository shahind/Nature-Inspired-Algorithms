Atom Search Optimization (ASO) is a new optimization approach for solving optimization problems. ASO mathematically models and mimics the atomic motion model in nature, where atoms interact with each other through interaction forces resulting form Lennard-Jones potential and constraint forces resulting from bond-length potential. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
