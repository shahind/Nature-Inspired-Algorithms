BAS: Beetle Antennae Search Algorithm for Optimization
Meta-heuristic algorithms have become very popular because of powerful performance on the optimization problem. A new algorithm called beetle antennae search algorithm (BAS) is proposed in the .m file inspired by the searching behavior of long-horn beetles. The BAS algorithm imitates the function of antennae and the random walking mechanism of beetles in nature, and then two main steps of detecting and searching are implemented. Finally, the algorithm is benchmarked on the Michalewicz function, in which the numerical results validate the efficacy of the proposed BAS algorithm.
