test: Script file of Artificial Bee Colony Optimization
uses file Griewank
uses file ABC (and all its other required files)

Other four commonly used test problems (Rastrigin, Schaffer, SphereNew , Rosenbrock) are also available in the folder

Statistical analysis and other plots can be implemented as discussed in https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74091-teaching-learning-based-optimization

Also refer https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65794-single-objective-artificial-bee-colony-optimization for termination criterion being number of functional evaluations (instead of number of cycles).
