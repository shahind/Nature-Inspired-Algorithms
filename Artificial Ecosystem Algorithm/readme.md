Artificial ecosystem-based optimization (AEO) is a new optimization approach for solving optimization problems. SDO is motivated from the flow of energy in an ecosystem on the earth, this algorithm mimics three unique behaviors of living organisms, including production, consumption, and decomposition. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
