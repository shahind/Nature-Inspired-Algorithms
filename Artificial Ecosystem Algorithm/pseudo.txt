Randomly initialize an ecosystem Xi ( solutions) and caculate the
fitness Fiti, and Xbest= the best solution found so far.
While the stop criterion is not satisfied do
//Production//
For individual X1, update its solution using equation (1).
//Consumption//
For individual Xi (i=2,...,n),
// Herbivore //
Ifrand<1/3 then update its solution using equation (6),
// Omnivore //
Else If 1/3 <= rand <= 2/3 then update its solution using equation (7),
// Carnivore //
Else update its solution using equation (8),
 End If.
End If.
Caculate the fitness of each individual.
Update the best solution found so far Xbest.
// Decomposition//
Update the position of each individual using equation (9).
Caculate the fitness of each individual.
Update the best solution found so far Xbest.
End While.
Return Xbest.
