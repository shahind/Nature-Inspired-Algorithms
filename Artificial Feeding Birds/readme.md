Metaheuristic_Optimizer is a collection of metaheuristic optimization algorithms for Python (any version: Python 2, Python 3, Pypy 2 and Pypy 3).

It contains algorithms for nonlinear optimization and ordering optimization (such as TSP, traveling salesman problem).

Included algorithms:

Artificial Feeding Birds (AFB) (nonlinear and ordering)
Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) (nonlinear)
Firefly Algorithm (FA) (nonlinear)
Random-key-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) (ordering)
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (ordering)
