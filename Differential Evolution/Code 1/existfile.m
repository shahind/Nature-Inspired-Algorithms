function res = existfile(fileName)
%EXISTFILE  Check for file existence.
%    RES = EXISTFILE(FILENAME) returns true if the file FILENAME is existing
%    on the current path and false otherwise. It works similar to
%    EXIST(FILENAME, 'file'), except that it does not find files on the
%    Matlab path!
%
%    The function is realized as a mex function (existfile.c). To compile
%    the mex-function, move to the directory where file existfile.c is
%    located and type
%    
%      mex existfile.c
%
%    If this is the first time you run function MEX on your system, you
%    might have to select a compiler by typing
%
%      mex -setup
%
%    If the mex-file (e.g. existfile.mexw32 or existfile.mexglx) is not
%    existing, a (very slow) MATLAB realization is called instead.
%
%    Example:
%    existfile('test.txt');
